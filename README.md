### Description

Hi I'm Nallely Campos, I developed NaiatApex with React and CSS as a final project of LatinasCodeCamp2023, it is a bank-type app. It has a login-form  validated by a username and password, if they are incorrect or incomplete displays a message to review the input; if they are correct, it allows access.

Once the user is logged, the program displays a welcome message and you can clic on options from the sidebar-menu. The menu has icons and tooltips.

+ The user(s) can change their PIN 
+ Check the monetary value of their share and the value of them in the market 
+ Choose how many shares you want to sell or buy 
+ Add money to your account (each deposit is associated with the date it was made, the amount deposited, and this amount is added to the current balance)
+ Check a balance sheet, that includes the user's data, their account movements, a button to print the info showed on screen and the date of printing.
+ At the end of the session, the app displays a farewell message and redirects to the login screen with the form fields cleared and ready to be used once again.

Learn how to use React DOM, React-routes paths and NavLinks to call multiple components or pages based on urls, in a single window. For example:

~~~  
<BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={<Home />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
